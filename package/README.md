# 🐛 MondJS

**_Monadic Error Handling for JavaScript/TypeScript_**

[![Minzipped size][bundlephobia-src]][bundlephobia-href]

</div>

## 👋🏼 About

**MondJS** is a _lightweight_ JavaScript/TypeScript library that brings **monadic error handling**, _inspired by Rust_, to your codebase.

This approach to **error handling is more robust and reliable** than traditional exception handling, which should be reserved for truly exceptional cases, rather than used as the primary method for managing common errors in general situations.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation 📥

`npm:`

```
npm install mondjs
```

`yarn:`

```
yarn add mondjs
```

`pnpm:`

```
